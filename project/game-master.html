                Game Masters, or GM's, are players too. They may have control of dozens on dozens of NPC's (non-player characters) as well as the environment, whether social or geographical, but they are also players and they are there to tell a story together. The biggest thing to remember is that no matter what is planned, a dice roll or player choice can derail a carefully made plan for the story to go somewhere specific and it is not bad if they have to throw out that plan in order ot keep everyone, themselves included, engaged. The simplest way to introduce challenges is with the dice. Narrating a scenario and keeping in mind what specific rolls Players will need or waiting to see what ideas the Players come up with is the GM's primary job as it helps to offer low scale challenges and conflicts for the players to overcome. Some cases it may be more social and others, you just have to fight a Giant Bear.
