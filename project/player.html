                Players' job in Genesys is to pick a role or career and to use that as their specialty of what they are good at. Picking a lightweight class more akin to a monk or thief or negotiator will allow them to have easier access bujidling someone who talks things down or is very quick to dodge. Something heavier, heavy plate mail, is more likely to be a fighter or someone to recieve a lot of damage. Once the career is chosen, they can upgrade different skills such as a combat skill or the ability to negotiate for a better price on sales, or even to coerce and intimidate your way to gain access to otherwise restricted areas. Creating a personality for this character will also help to give building blocks for the GM and other Players to interact with your character and allow them to make the story deeper, richer, and more meaningful, often even more humorous.
